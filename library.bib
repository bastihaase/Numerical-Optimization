abstract = {NL2SOL is a modular program for solving the nonlinear least-squares problem that incorporates a number of novel features. It maintains a secant approximation S to the second-order part of the least-squares Hessian and adaptively decides when to use this approximation. We have found it very helpful to "size" S before updating it, something which looks much akin to Oren-Luenberger scaling. Rather than resorting to line searches or Levenberg-Marquardt modifications, we use the double-dogleg scheme of Dennis and Mei together with a special module for assessing the quality of the step thus computed. We discuss these and other ideas behind NL2SOL and briefly describe its evolution and current implementation.},

By means of the embedding ?? this results in the unification, in the graded case, of the Gr??bner bases theories for commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. Finally, since the ring of ordinary difference polynomials P=K[X??N] fits the proposed theory one obtains that, with respect to a suitable grading, the Gr??bner bases of finitely generated graded ordinary difference ideals can be computed also in the operators ring S and in a finite number of steps up to some fixed degree. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Under the assumption that the K-variety G is K-rational, i.e. that the function field is purely transcendant, it was proved that a principal homogeneous space of G has a rational point over K as soon as it has one over each completion of K with respect to a discrete valuation. In this paper we show that one cannot in general do without the K-rationality assumption. To produce our examples, we introduce a new type of obstruction. It is based on higher reciprocity laws on a 2-dimensional scheme. We also produce a family of principal homogeneous spaces for which the refined obstruction controls exactly the existence of rational points.},

This theorem is both the culmination of work initiated by Brauer, Noether, Hasse and Albert and the starting point of current research in motivic cohomology theory by Voevodsky, Suslin, Rost and others. Assuming only a solid background in algebra, but no homological algebra, the book covers the basic theory of central simple algebras, methods of Galois descent and Galois cohomology, Severi-Brauer varieties, residue maps and, finally, Milnor K-theory and K-cohomology. The last chapter rounds off the theory by presenting the results in positive characteristic, including the theorem of Bloch-Gabber-Kato.

We show that many such examples may be accounted for by a Brauer-Manin obstruction for the existence of integral points on schemes defined over the integers.

abstract = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},

abstract = {The theory of schemes is the foundation for algebraic geometry proposed and elaborated by Alexander Grothendieck and his co-workers. It has allowed major progress in classical areas of algebraic geometry such as invariant theory and the moduli of curves. It integrates algebraic number theory with algebraic geometry, fulfilling the dreams of earlier generations of number theorists. This integration has led to proofs of some of the major conjectures in number theory (Deligne's proof of the Weil Conjectures, Faltings' proof of the Mordell Conjecture).This book is intended to bridge the chasm between a first course in classical algebraic geometry and a technical treatise on schemes. It focuses on examples, and strives to show "what is going on" behind the definitions. There are many exercises to test and extend the reader's understanding. The prerequisites are modest: a little commutative algebra and an acquaintance with algebraic varieties, roughly at the level of a one-semester course. The book aims to show schemes in relation to other geometric ideas, such as the theory of manifolds. Some familiarity with these ideas is helpful, though not required.},

It is natural to ask whether this is also true for G-quadratic forms, where G is a finite group. In the case of number fields the Hasse principle for G-quadratic forms does not hold in general, as shown by Jorge Morales. The aim of this paper is to study this question when k is a global field of positive characteristic.

This is a manifestation of the exceptional isomorphism A{\_}1{\^{}}2 = D{\_}2 degenerating to the exceptional isomorphism A{\_}1 = B{\_}1. In one direction, the even Clifford algebra yields the map. In the other direction, we show that the classical algebra norm functor can be uniquely extended over the discriminant divisor. Along the way, we study the orthogonal group schemes, which are smooth yet nonreductive, of quadratic forms with simple degeneration. Finally, we provide two surprising applications: constructing counter-examples to the local-global principle for isotropy, with respect to discrete valuations, of quadratic forms over surfaces; and a new proof of the global Torelli theorem for very general cubic fourfolds containing a plane.},

The notion of "letterplace correspondence" introduced in [1,2] for the graded (two-sided) ideals of {\$}K\backslash < x{\_}i\backslash >{\$} is extended in this paper also to the nongraded case. This amounts to the possibility of modelizing nongraded noncommutative presented algebras by means of a class of graded commutative algebras that are invariant under the action of the monoid {\$}\backslashmathbb N{\$} of natural numbers. For such purpose we develop the notion of saturation for the graded ideals of {\$}K\backslash < x{\_}i,t\backslash >{\$}, where {\$}t{\$} is an extra variable and for their letterplace analogues in the commutative polynomial algebra {\$}K[x{\_}{\{}ij{\}},t{\_}j]{\$}, where {\$}j{\$} ranges in {\$}\backslashmathbb N{\$}. In particular, one obtains an alternative algorithm for computing inhomogeneous noncommutative Gr$\backslash$"obner bases using just homogeneous commutative polynomials. The feasibility of the proposed methods is shown by an experimental implementation developed in the computer algebra system Maple and by using standard routines for the Buchberger algorithm contained in Singular.

abstract = {The Milnor conjecture has been a driving force in the theory of quadratic forms over fields, guiding the development of the theory of cohomological invariants, ushering in the theory of motivic cohomology, and touching on questions ranging from sums of squares to the structure of absolute Galois groups. Here, we survey some recent work on generalizations of the Milnor conjecture to the context of schemes (mostly smooth varieties over fields of characteristic not 2). Surprisingly, a version of the Milnor conjecture fails to hold for certain smooth complete p-adic curves with no rational theta characteristic (this is the work of Parimala, Scharlau, and Sridharan). We explain how these examples fit into the larger context of an unramified Milnor question, offer a new approach to the question, and discuss new results in the case of curves over local fields and surfaces over finite fields.},

@article{Parimala2010a,
abstract = {Let F be a finite field and l a prime not equal to the characteristic of F. Let K be the function field of a surface over F. Assume that K contains a primitive lth root of unity. In the paper we prove a certain local-global principle for elements of H{\^{}}3(K, {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}{\_}l) in terms of symbols in H{\^{}}2(K, {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}{\_}l) with respect to discrete valuations of K. We also show that this local global principle is equivalent to the vanishing of certain unramified cohomology groups of 3-folds over finite fields. Using this local-global principle we show that every element in H{\^{}}3(F, {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}{\_}l) is a symbol. The vanishing of the unramified cohomology groups has consequences in the study of integral Tate conjecture and Brauer-Manin obstruction for existence of zero-cycles.},

abstract = {This paper provides applications of patching to quadratic forms and central simple algebras over function fields of curves over henselian valued fields. In particular, we use a patching approach to reprove and generalize a recent result of Parimala and Suresh on the u-invariant of p-adic function fields, for p odd. The strategy relies on a local-global principle for homogeneous spaces for rational algebraic groups, combined with local computations.},
